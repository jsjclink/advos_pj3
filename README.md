In this project you will create a wrapper of a flat file system that offers persistence and
crash recovery guarantees through the use of recoverable virtual memory.
You will need to implement specific API calls based on the provided code skeleton, and pass certain test cases.

You may discuss ideas with students in the class, but the project must be done **by you and your teammate**.
Copying others is NEVER allowed for any reason.
